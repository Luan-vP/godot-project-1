# godot-project-1

A 2D game about floaty eye thingies, in a painterly style. Godot 4.4.

## Layout

- `features/fluid/` — the fluid the eyes float in: GPU simulation, painterly
  rendering, and the coupling that lets bodies drift on it and stir it back.
  See its [README](features/fluid/README.md).
- `features/floaters/` — the eye floaters themselves: specks that drift and
  sink on the fluid. See its [README](features/floaters/README.md).
- `features/levels/secret_eyes/` — a secret level built on the fluid: a tank
  full of floaty eyes. See its [README](features/levels/secret_eyes/README.md).
- `features/levels/panorama/` — the main level's core mechanic: a camera at
  the centre of a look-around panoramic background. See its
  [README](features/levels/panorama/README.md).
- `features/player/` — `PanoramaLookCamera`, the camera the panorama level
  looks around with.
- `core/motion/` — device tilt and jog behind a port, so the controls can be
  developed on a desktop and tested in CI. See its
  [README](core/motion/README.md).
- `core/look/` — camera look input (mouse, gamepad) behind a port, the same
  shape as `core/motion`. See its [README](core/look/README.md).
- `core/audio/` — the audio foundation: bus layout, `AudioManager`, and a
  manual demo scene to prove it makes a sound. See its
  [README](core/audio/README.md).
- `autoload/` — global singletons (`EventBus`, `GameState`, `AudioManager`,
  `SaveManager`).
- `addons/` — vendored third-party code; see [addons/README.md](addons/README.md).
- `tests/` — GUT suite.

Pressing play currently runs the secret eye level, since there is no main
level yet — see [its README](features/levels/secret_eyes/README.md) for
controls and how it stays secret once a main level exists.

## Running the tests

```sh
godot --headless -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gdir=res://tests -gexit
```

## Linting

CI runs `gdformat --check` and `gdlint` over our own GDScript only —
`addons/` is vendored and not ours to reformat.

```sh
pip install "gdtoolkit==4.*"
gdformat autoload core features resources tests
gdlint autoload core features resources tests
```
